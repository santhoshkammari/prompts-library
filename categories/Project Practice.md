Instead of:
"Give me a project idea and its solution"

Better prompts:
"Can you give me a challenging project idea for practicing [specific skill]? Please:
1. Start with requirements gathering questions
2. Let me propose a solution approach
3. Review my design decisions
4. Guide me through implementation challenges without giving direct solutions
Let's begin with the requirements discussion."
