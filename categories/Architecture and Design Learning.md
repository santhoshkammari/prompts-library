Instead of:
"What's the best architecture for my project?"

Better prompts:
"I'm building a [type of application]. Can you walk me through the thought process of choosing an architecture? What factors should I consider? After you explain, I'll propose my design for discussion."

"Can you explain the trade-offs between these three architectural patterns for my use case? I'll then explain back my understanding and which one I think fits best."
