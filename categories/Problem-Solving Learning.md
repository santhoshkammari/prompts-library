Instead of:
"How do I fix this error in my code: [error message]"

Better prompts:
"I'm getting this error: [error message]. Can you guide me through the debugging process? What questions should I be asking myself to diagnose the issue?"

"Before showing me the solution, can you help me understand what might be causing this error and what debugging steps I should take? I want to learn the troubleshooting process."
