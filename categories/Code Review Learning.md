Instead of:
"Review this code and fix the bugs"

Better prompts:
"Here's my code: [code]. Can you first point out areas that could be improved without giving me the solution? After I make my own attempts at improvement, I'll share the updated version for another review."

"I wrote this function: [code]. Can you ask me probing questions about my design decisions? I want to understand if there are better approaches I haven't considered."
