Instead of:
"Write code for a binary search tree implementation"

Better prompts:
"Can you explain the core principles of a binary search tree? Then let me try implementing it, and you can review my code."

"I'm trying to understand binary search trees. Can you explain each operation (insert, delete, search) step by step, and then give me a small challenge to implement one of these operations?"
