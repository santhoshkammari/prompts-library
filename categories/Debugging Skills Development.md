Instead of:
"Why isn't this code working?"

Better prompts:
"I have this bug: [description]. Can you help me build a systematic debugging approach by:
1. Asking me what I've tried so far
2. Suggesting what logs or tests might be helpful
3. Guiding me to identify the root cause myself
I'll share my findings after each step."
