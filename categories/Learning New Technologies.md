Instead of:
"How do I use Technology X?"

Better prompts:
"I'm learning [Technology X]. Can you create a learning roadmap for me, starting with fundamental concepts? For each concept, I'd like to:
1. Get a brief explanation
2. Try a small practice exercise
3. Discuss my solution with you
Let's start with the first concept."

"Before I dive into [Technology X], what are the prerequisite concepts I should understand? Can you check my current knowledge by asking me a few key questions?"
