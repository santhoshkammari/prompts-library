Instead of:
"What are the best practices for writing clean code?"

Better prompts:
"Can you review this code snippet I wrote: [code]? Instead of telling me how to improve it, can you ask me questions that would lead me to discover potential improvements in:
1. Readability
2. Maintainability
3. Performance
After each question, I'll think about it and propose changes."
